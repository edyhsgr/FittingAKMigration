EDDIE'S R CODE FOR FITTING THE MODEL MIGRATION SCHEDULE WITH STUDENT PEAK APPLIED TO ALASKA 2011 TO 2015 OUT-MIGRATION (ANNUAL AND AVERAGE ANNUAL FOR THE PERIOD)

-----

STEPS: Everything is run with the R code in ReadRunWriteByYear.txt

ReadRunWriteByYear.txt just needs its directory paths updated. It relies on:

(1) the input data - SPMMSData_AKExample.csv

(2) the R code with the input starting parameters/parameter ranges (just best guesses) - 
InputParametersOrParameterRanges.txt

(3) the R code for fitting - Fitting.txt

CombinedPlots.pdf is output plots from ReadRunWriteByYear.txt, all combined

SOME NOTES: I just used very broad possible parameter bounds to fit all to, and included all parameters (no matter overfitting etc), but ~fun to see/think about. All parameters/ranges I used are as given in InputParametersOrParameterRanges.txt. It's very slow, and I'm thinking it could probably use some apply()'s and cleanup, and warning messages (esp for when bounds are not wide enough), plus review for problems/errors, but ~neat/fun in any case. -Eddie Hunsinger, September 2018
