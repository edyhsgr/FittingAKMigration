EDDIE'S R CODE FOR FITTING THE MODEL MIGRATION SCHEDULE WITH STUDENT PEAK APPLIED TO ALASKA 2011 TO 2015 OUT-MIGRATION

-----

STEPS: Everything is run with the R code in ReadRunWriteByYear.txt

ReadRunWriteByYear.txt just needs its directory paths updated. It relies on:

(1) the input data - SPMMSData_AKExample.csv

(2) the R code with the input starting parameters/parameter ranges (just best guesses) - 
InputParametersOrParameterRanges.txt

(3) the R code for fitting - Fitting.txt

CombinedPlots.pdf is output plots from ReadRunWriteByYear.txt, all combined

SOME NOTES: I just used very broad possible parameter bounds to fit all to, and included all parameters (no matter overfitting etc), but ~fun to see/think about. It's very slow, and I'm thinking it could probably use some apply()'s and cleanup, and warning messages (esp if bounds are not wide enough), plus review for problems/errors, but ~neat/fun in any case. -Eddie Hunsinger, September 2018
