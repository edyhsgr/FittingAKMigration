EDDIE'S R CODE FOR FITTING THE ROGERS-CASTRO MODEL MIGRATION SCHEDULE WITH WILSON'S STUDENT PEAK, APPLIED TO ALASKA 2011 TO 2015 OUT-MIGRATION (ANNUAL AND AVERAGE ANNUAL FOR THE PERIOD)

-----

STEPS: Everything is run with the R code in ReadRunWriteByYear.txt

It relies on:

(1) the input data - SPMMSData_AKExample.csv

(2) the R code with the input starting parameters/parameter ranges (just best guesses) - 
InputParametersOrParameterRanges.txt

(3) the R code for fitting - Fitting.txt

Each of these three items ReadRunWriteByYear.txt relies on is linked through the Internet, so you should be able to simply select-all, copy and paste ReadRunWriteByYear.txt into an R command line to make it work. 

CombinedPlots.pdf and CombinedPlots.gif is output plots from ReadRunWriteByYear.txt, all combined

SOME NOTES: I just used very broad possible parameter bounds to fit all to, and included all parameters (no matter overfitting etc), but ~fun to see/think about. All parameters/ranges I used are as given in InputParametersOrParameterRanges.txt. It's very slow, and I'm thinking it could probably use some apply()'s and cleanup, and warning messages (esp for when bounds are not wide enough), plus review for problems/errors, but ~neat/fun in any case. -Eddie Hunsinger, September 2018
